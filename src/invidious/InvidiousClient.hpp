// Alternative to YoutubeClient::parse() for fetching a single video's
// metadata + playable stream URLs, routed through a randomly-selected
// Invidious instance instead of calling YouTube's InnerTube API directly
// from the device.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: see the comment above INNERTUBE_PLAYER_CLIENTS in
// YoutubeClient.cpp, and InvidiousInstanceManager.hpp -- in short, YouTube's
// PO-Token/SABR enforcement can leave BB10's direct InnerTube requests with
// no usable adaptive (720p+) stream URL. Invidious instances run their own
// server-side attestation (some via "invidious-companion", a headless
// BotGuard solver) and often have better luck. This is NOT guaranteed --
// individual instances can be just as blocked as we are, which is why this
// class retries across MAX_INSTANCE_ATTEMPTS different random instances
// before giving up.
//
// INTERFACE PARITY WITH YoutubeClient: emits the same
// metadataReceived(VideoMetadata, StorageData) / error(QString) signals as
// YoutubeClient, so callers (BasePage) can swap between the two without
// changing anything downstream (PlayerPage, StorageParser's consumers,
// remux, quality picker, etc. are all untouched).
//
// C++03/GNU++98 only (matches bbtube's QNX/gcc 4.6.3 toolchain).
