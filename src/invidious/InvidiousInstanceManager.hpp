// Maintains bbtube's pool of Invidious instance base URLs (e.g.
// "http://76.82.152.76:3000"), modeled on notPipe's (gohoski/notPipe)
// multi-instance strategy: rather than hardcoding one instance -- which
// dies the moment it gets enough traffic for YouTube to notice and block
// it -- we fetch a community-maintained list and pick a new random
// instance for each request. This spreads load and avoids a single point
// of failure.
//
// SOURCE: notPipe's own auto-updating instance list at
// http://144.31.189.129/notPipe.json (see notPipe's README, "Automatic
// updates of the instances"), specifically its "invidious" key -- a
// list of independently-run Invidious instances. This was switched to
// from api.invidious.io (the "official" Invidious instance directory)
// because that domain requires HTTPS and consistently fails SSL
// handshake on this device (QNetworkReply::SslHandshakeFailedError,
// even with the correct CA already present in BB10's trust store -- the
// underlying cause was never fully pinned down, but is most likely an
// SNI or cipher-suite incompatibility between this old OpenSSL build and
// that server's TLS config). notPipe.json's "invidious" entries are
// plain HTTP, which sidesteps the whole problem, at the cost of the
// instance list traffic itself being unencrypted (the video
// URLs/metadata fetched FROM a chosen instance are a separate, later
// concern -- see InvidiousClient).
//
// notPipe.json's other keys ("yt2009", "piped", "ytapilegacy") are
// deliberately NOT used here: yt2009 is an HTML/Flash frontend, not a
// JSON API, and would need an entirely different (HTML-scraping)
// client; piped and ytapilegacy have their own, different JSON schemas
// that InvidiousClient's parser (written for Invidious's
// /api/v1/videos/ format) does not understand.
//
// IMPORTANT CAVEAT (do not remove this comment without re-reading it):
// Invidious instances are not immune to the same PO-Token/SABR problems
// bbtube's direct InnerTube client hits -- see the large comment above
// INNERTUBE_PLAYER_CLIENTS in YoutubeClient.cpp for the full background.
// Some instances run "invidious-companion" (a server-side BotGuard
// solver) and have a much better success rate than bbtube calling
// YouTube directly, but there is no guarantee any given instance, at any
// given moment, can actually produce a playable URL for a given video.
// InvidiousClient (separate file) is expected to try more than one
// instance per video if the first one comes back empty.
//
// C++03/GNU++98 only (matches bbtube's QNX/gcc 4.6.3 toolchain).
